This Jupyter notebook provides an in-depth analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria from 2020 to 2022. 

The analysis includes the total confirmed, deaths, and recoveries cases, mortality rate, recovery rate, daily and monthly average of confirmed, death, and recovered cases, the most affected state, and correlation between the number of confirmed, death, and recovery cases.

The analysis provides valuable insights into the pandemic in Nigeria and highlights the need for continued efforts to control the spread of the disease and support those who have been affected by it.
